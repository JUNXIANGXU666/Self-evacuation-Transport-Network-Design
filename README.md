# Self-evacuation-Transport-Network-Design This is a private database on the self-evacuation transport network design, including the underlying road data, road flow data, and latitude and longitude data for selected nodes on the Sydney Central Coast used in the project's case analysis studies, as well as pseudo-code for the FW-NSGA-II algorithm for solving a bi-level programming model, for which the full solution code is not yet publicly available, and code for the FW algorithm for studying the equilibrium of the lower-level traffic assignment model.
